1. NaivecoinStake appears to have a simplified interpretation of Proof of Stake. It doesn't have advanced features such as staking some of your coins in a smart contract or slashing those coins if you incorrectly validate a block. It seems to randomly choose nodes as validators, with nodes that have more coins to their name having a greater chance of being chosen. I originally got confused by the parts about difficulty at the bottom of the
Proof of Stake chapter because that's associated with Proof of Work. PoW difficulty refers to the effort it takes to brute-force incremented numbers into a hash that starts with a certain number of 0's. NcS's difficulty just means the time it takes for a new block to be added to the blockchain.
