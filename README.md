# Nebu

ðŸš¨ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš¨

Nebu (from the name of the Ancient Egyptian symbol for gold) is a semi-serious proof-of-stake cryptocurrency written in Python. 

I intend for Nebu to be a highly simple open-source cryptocurrency that's mainly used for fun, but can also feasibly be used for real-world financial transactions (similar to Dogecoin). I'm coding it in proof-of-stake for 3 reasons:

  -1. PoS is a lot less computationally intensive than PoW, meaning it consumes a lot less electricity and is better for the environment. I do not want a mostly-for-fun cryptocoin to be as environmentally damaging as serious cryptos like Bitcoin.
  
  -2. I think PoS is more fair than PoW since it prioritizes those who have staked more rather than those who have more computational power, which allows for significant democratization.
  
  -3. I like the aesthetics of proof-of-stake over proof-of-work (e.g. I think "minting" sounds better than "mining"). That probably makes me sound like a weird person, but aren't we all?
